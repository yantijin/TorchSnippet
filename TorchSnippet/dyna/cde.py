    r"""Solves a system of controlled differential equations.

    Solves the controlled problem:
    ```
    z_t = z_{t_0} + \int_{t_0}^t f(s, z_s) dX_s
    ```
    where z is a tensor of any shape, and X is some controlling signal.

    Arguments:
        X: The control. This should be a instance of `torch.nn.Module`, with a `derivative` method. For example
            `torchcde.NaturalCubicSpline`. This represents a continuous path derived from the data. The
            derivative at a point will be computed via `X.derivative(t)`, where t is a scalar tensor. The returned
            tensor should have shape (..., input_channels), where '...' is some number of batch dimensions and
            input_channels is the number of channels in the input path.
        func: Should be a callable describing the vector field f(t, z). If using `adjoint=True` (the default), then
            should be an instance of `torch.nn.Module`, to collect the parameters for the adjoint pass. Will be called
            with a scalar tensor t and a tensor z of shape (..., hidden_channels), and should return a tensor of shape
            (..., hidden_channels, input_channels), where hidden_channels and input_channels are integers defined by the
            `hidden_shape` and `X` arguments as above. The '...' corresponds to some number of batch dimensions.
        z0: The initial state of the solution. It should have shape (..., hidden_channels), where '...' is some number
            of batch dimensions.
        t: a one dimensional tensor describing the times to range of times to integrate over and output the results at.
            The initial time will be t[0] and the final time will be t[-1].
        adjoint: A boolean; whether to use the adjoint method to backpropagate. Defaults to True.
        **kwargs: Any additional kwargs to pass to the odeint solver of torchdiffeq (the most common are `rtol`, `atol`,
            `method`, `options`).

    Returns:
        The value of each z_{t_i} of the solution to the CDE z_t = z_{t_0} + \int_0^t f(s, z_s)dX_s, where t_i = t[i].
        This will be a tensor of shape (..., len(t), hidden_channels).

    Raises:
        ValueError for malformed inputs.

    Warnings:
        Note that the returned tensor puts the sequence dimension second-to-last, rather than first like in
        `torchdiffeq.odeint`.

        If you need gradients with respect to t (which is quite unusual, but still), then don't use the particular
        combination of:
         - adjoint=True (the default)
         - linear interpolation with reparameterise='none' (the default) to construct X.
        It doesn't work. (For mathematical reasons: the adjoint method requires access to d2X_dt2, which is
        measure-valued for linear interpolation; this doesn't get detected during the solve so you wrongly end up with
        zero gradient.) Switch to either natural cubic splines or reparameterise='bump'.
